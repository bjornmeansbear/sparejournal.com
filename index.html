          <h1>Spare</h1>
          <h2>An Accesible Journal of Leisure</h2>

          <p>
            <cite>SPARE</cite> is a quarterly zine of essays, interviews, and artist projects about a vast range of topics focusing on both the production and enjoyment of contemporary leisure activities. Leisure means different things to different people — one person’s leisure activity may be another person’s hard day of work. But generally it is about freetime, relaxing, and pleasure. <cite>SPARE</cite> is interested in exploring recreation, leisure, sport, and good times.
          </p>

          <p>
            <cite>SPARE</cite> is produced by Christopher Attenborough and Kristian Bjornard.

          <h2>First Theme: Seeking</h2>
          <p>
            We spend a good amount of our leisure time seeking. Seeking involves the process of locating new places, objects, experiences, and ideas. It is about gaining new knowledge and new pleasure through discovery. The act of seeking out things or experiences becomes a hobby in itself.
          </p>

          <p>
            In the producing of <cite>SPARE</cite> we seek content submissions — so, this topic seemed like the perfect place to start. We invite you to submit a piece for our first issue that is conceptually relevant to the idea of seeking.
          </p>

          <h2>Submissions</h2>

          <p>
            Submissions to <cite>SPARE</cite> are very open — essays, poetry, photos, drawings, etc. can be submitted — but, we do have a few guidelines so that we can easily format the zine. <cite>SPARE</cite> will only accept electronic submissions — this is for text, photos, and representations of artist’s projects.
          </p>

          <p>
            Please email submissions to <a href="mailto:team@sparejournal.com">team@sparejournal.com</a>
