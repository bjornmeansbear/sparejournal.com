          <h1>Spare</h1>
          <h2>An Accesible Journal of Leisure</h2>

          <p>
            SPARE is a quarterly zine of essays, interviews, and artist projects about a vast range of topics focusing on both the production and enjoyment of contemporary leisure activities. Leisure means different things to different people — one person’s leisure activity may be another person’s hard day of work. But generally it is about freetime, relaxing, and pleasure. SPARE is interested in exploring recreation, leisure, sport, and good times.
          </p>

          <p>
            SPARE is produced by Christopher Attenborough and Kristian Bjornard.

          <h2>First Theme: Seeking</h2>
          <p>
            We spend a good amount of our leisure time seeking. Seeking involves the process of locating new places, objects, experiences, and ideas. It is about gaining new knowledge and new pleasure through discovery. The act of seeking out things or experiences becomes a hobby in itself.
          </p>

          <p>
            In the producing of SPARE we seek content submissions — so, this topic seemed like the perfect place to start. We invite you to submit a piece for our first issue that is conceptually relevant to the idea of seeking.

          <h2>Submissions</h2>

          <p>
            Submissions to SPARE are very open — essays, poetry, photos, drawings, etc. can be submitted — but, we do have a few guidelines so that we can easily format the zine. SPARE will only accept electronic submissions — this is for text, photos, and representations of artist’s projects.
          </p>

          <h2>Guidelines</h2>

          <ul>
            <li>include the word "submission" in the subject line of your submission.</li>
            <li>The artist’s/author’s name(s), snail-mail and e-mail address(es), phone number(s), as well as a very short biography must appear on the first page of the text.</li>
            <li>You may submit any type of prose — essays, poetry, fiction, etc. The writing should be accessible to a sophisticated general readership.</li>
            <li>Please include relevant images as jpgs. Please don’t send full-res images up front (no larger than 1500-2000px w/h). If we select your work, we will ask for originals, which must be large enough for print. Smaller and/or individual images may be paired with written content.</li>
            <li>Text should be submitted as a google document, markdown document, plaintext file, or any other basic file format we can open with Word. </li>
            <li>We accept submissions for performance/sound/video/film art with a written description and when possible an image should accompany the piece. </li>
            <li>Submissions deadline for Seeking is February 1, 2015</li>
          </ul>
